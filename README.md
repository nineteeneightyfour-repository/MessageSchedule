# MessageSchedule
The MessageSchedule app makes it possible to create and schedule sending of SMS/MMS to one or more recipients. All SMS/MMS are stored in a local database. One application of this app could for instance be in the situation where you want to remind your child/children of important events during the week that must be done.

The primary function of this app is to, via a weekly schedule, send "related" SMS/MMS to one or more recipient, but of course, it is still possible to create a single SMS/MMS for a single specific date (in the future) to be sent as a "reminder" to one or more recipient (perhaps yourself).

The app allows you to decide (via the Settings menu under the Options menu)
- if a "sending confirmation" is required for each sent SMS/MMS and
- if a "reading confirmation" is required for each sent SMS/MMS.

From the Options menu it is possible to import and export schedules if you for instance with share your schedules with a friend. Note however that no images are imported since thees are represented with URL's local to your phone.

To start sending messages, turn the switch on the main page on.

Note that "when everything is in place", the app and the screen can be turned off without affecting the scheduling.
